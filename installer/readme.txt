InvokeAI

Project homepage: https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI

Installation on Windows:

  You may need to enable Windows Long Paths to install InvokeAI. If
  you're not sure what this is, you almost certainly need to do
  this. Simply double-click the "WinLongPathsEnabled.reg" file located
  in this directory, and approve the Windows warnings. Note that you
  will need to have admin privileges in order to do this.

  Then double-click the 'install.bat' file (while keeping it inside
  the InvokeAI-Installer folder).

Installation on Linux and Mac:

  Please open the terminal, and run './install.sh' (while keeping it
  inside the InvokeAI-Installer folder).

The installer will create a directory named "invokeai" in the folder
of your choice. This directory contains everything you need to run
invokeai. You may delete this folder (InvokeAI-Installer) at your
convenience.
